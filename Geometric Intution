z=w1x1+w2x2+b
y=f(z)=1 if z>=0
y=f(z)=0 if z<0

we will plot cpi Vs iq graph.
The dots showing placed will be green and those not placed will be red.
Our end goal is to get a DL model in which when we give it any point,it will predict whether placement occured or not.

Geometrically,the perceptron is a line.
if(w1x1+w2x2+b>=0) then placement will occur.This is a region.The perceptron is dividing the region into two parts.Perceptron is a line using which we are creating two 
regions.Perceptron is a binary classifier.
In 3D,there will be 3 variables,thus a 3D region.
Therefore,in 3D  coordinate system,the perceptron will be a plane.
4D onwards,perceptron will act as a hyperplane.

Limitation:-Perceptron can classify only linear or sort of linear data i.e, those data points which can be seperated by a line.
For a completely non linear dataset,perceptron will fail.
