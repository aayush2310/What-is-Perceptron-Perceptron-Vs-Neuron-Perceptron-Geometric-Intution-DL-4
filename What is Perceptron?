Perceptron is an algorithm.Used for supervised ML.Its just bcz the design of perceptron is as such that as it automatically became the building block of DL.
Perceptron is also a mathematical model/function.

Mathematical design of perceptron:-
                             1------b------>(sum)-----z---->(f)------>
                                             /\
                                             |
                             X2-----W2--------
                   (INPUT)                   |
                             X1-----W1--------
                            
The connection b/w blocks are called weights and biases.W1,W2=>weights,,b=>bias
z=1.b+X2.W2+X1.W1=>dot product sum.
z travels forward and multiplies with f(activation func.) whose work is to take z to a given range.

We have data of 1000 students of iq,cpi,placement.
We need to model a predictron.
Using perceptron if i want to solve this problem then there are 2 stages:-
(i)training  (ii)Prediction
For each student X1 will be iq and X2 will be cpi.
The core objective of the training process is to get the value of W1,W2 and b.
Now we have got the value of W1,W2,b i.e,-W1=1,W2=2,b=3
z=100*1+5.1*2+3*1=113.2>0=>placement will happen.

What is I have more than 2 i/p cols?
=>I will provide that many X as i have the number of i/p cols.
